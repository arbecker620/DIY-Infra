# DIY Homelab

## Introduction
This is documented process on how I created my homelab. My homelab has been focused on creating an opportunity to host projects, create pipelines, and improve my technical acumen. There is definitely a better or optimized way of doing a homelab. I just did what I knew at the time and what challenges I weas working with.

### Hardware
I am trying to balance the tehcnical needs of a project while also trying to learn as much as I can. When I do any code development I try to do development on a Macbook Air. For other devices on my network I am using a Raspberry Pi 4 and a Raspberry Pi3. I have done some research onto adding in SFF devices for my home lab and really just havent wanted to make the commitment since I have an extra set of RPIs sitting around.
